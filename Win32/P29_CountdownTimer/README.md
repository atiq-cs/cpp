## Countdown Timer and System Tray
Noob Code warning! Probably written around 2009.

It is collection of a bunch of code segments from various sources.
Probably the WndProc / WM Messaging is messed up; window doesn't show up!

It's here coz I don't have time to isolate the useful code segments from this messy source file. It is archived here for future use.

Motley of code related to,
- Date / time conversion
- Sys Tray Notification
- C++ string manipulation, read/write file

**P29: Countdown Timer and System Tray**  
Noob Code warning! Probably written around 2009.

It is collection of a bunch of code segments from various sources.
Probably the WndProc / WM Messaging is messed up; window doesn't show up!

It's here since there's scarcity of time to isolate the useful code segments from this messy source file. It is archived here for future references.

Motley of code related to,
- Date / time conversion
- Sys Tray Notification
- C++ string manipulation, read/write file

## P03 Window Based Template
\*\* *Note this is an outdated template compared to VS 2022. TODO: update it based on P04_VS2022*  

This is an OOP Skeleton with an actual Window as Base.

Previous two projects,
- P01_Modeless, and,
- P02_Modeless_KB

founded the OOP code based on a Modeless Dialog. However, this one is founded on a Wnd.

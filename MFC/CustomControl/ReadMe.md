### Custom Control Projects
Listings,  
- [VC Samples](https://github.com/atiq-cs/cpp/blob/dev/MFC/Tutorials/VCSamples.md) contains custom control related samples

*Most of these are emot icon related custom control projects.*

1. [Bitmap Viwer Control](./BitmapCtrl/)  
First one is Bitmap Viwer Control in which we attempt rendering a bitmap image on a control.

2. [Chat Box with Emot Icon Support](./P02_ChatBoxEmo/)  
A custom control demo to implement a Chat Box supporting emot icon and chat history.

3. [Chat Box with Emot Icon Support CListCtrl](./P03_ChatBoxEmoListCtrl/)
CListCtrl control to support emot icons.  

4. [Chat Box with Emot Icon Support Robust](./P05_EmotIconChat/)
More robust custom control to support emot icons.  

ref 1 below (*codeproject - Creating and Using custom controls in VC++*) provides an easy demo how to go about creating a simple custom control in MFC.

**CListCtrl**  
Not exactly custom control project. However, we tried to customize a `ClistCtrl` based on ref 3. Alex Gagarin critics this implementation on [his blog](https://jongampark.wordpress.com/2009/09/19/why-mfc-is-bad).
